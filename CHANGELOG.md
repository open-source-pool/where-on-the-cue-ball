# `v0.0.1`: AI slop

Prompted Codex with the following:

```
make a simple react + tailwind app for visualizing contact point on cue ball. here are some instructions.
* the main interface is a white circle representing the cue ball (57.2mm)
* the user move around a smaller back dot representing the tip position (say 12.4mm), which can be placed on the cue ball at half-tip (6.2mm) intervals. the visual effect is snapping to the grid points.
* the grid is centered at the geometric center of the 2D cueball cross section, and points in the coordinate system are coded relative to it in cardinal directions, e.g. N1 means 1 tip up from the center of the cue ball
* there should be a text field showing the current position of the tip on the diagram
* there should be a way to download the image as a standalone png or svg
